# Xian

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.5.5. As such, it functions like one would expect in terms of building it.

## Aim

For now this will just be my personal little playground to get used to Angular as well as Typescript. This being my first larger project in terms of web-development, there will be unavoidable problems that _hopefully_ will one day be cleaned and fixed. Don't bet on it.

If by any weird chance I do in fact have the time to commit myself to this, the plan is to make a variant Idle-Game. Don't ask me what exactly I mean with that, just know that I do have some ideas.
